========

A simple ZNC Web Interface theme build with Twitter Bootstrap Framework.

This 'dev' (development) branch is mainly for ZNC v.1.7-git or later. 

### Update

June 11th 2015: Work is in progress. Some bits might not run smoothly (broken) on ZNC v.1.7-git as of now. Hang in there.

### To-Do

- The user setings page is way too long. Find a way to make it short yet organized
- Clean out the codes and align accordingly
- Swap to a switch-like checkbox
- Test Google Charts to output Traffic data, visually 
- Tables should be made more responsive, able to view on smaller devices
